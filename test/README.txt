Some of these tests require the Feed Parser tests. These can be downloaded in the package "feedparser-tests" from <uri:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=112328>. All you have to do is move the entire tests folder to this "test" folder.

Also, if you want to run this from the command line, you'll need to grab the Pear Package Console_Color from <uri:http://pear.php.net/package/Console_Color/download> and move Console_Color/Color.php to this "test" folder (this legally cannot be included here, as the two licenses conflict with one another).
